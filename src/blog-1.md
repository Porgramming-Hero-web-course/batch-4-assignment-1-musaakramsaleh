The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.
In typescript Union and Intersection types are unique and powerful features that allows developer to create flexible and type safe code.
 1. Union Types
 It allows a value to be of different types increasing the efficiency and also helping in implementing different types of functionality. It is defined y | pipe symbol. It ensures type flexibility through enabling a variable to be declared in different types at the same time and although it will take different inputs type safety will be ensured.Then it does not compromise type safety rather typescript enforces that the only specified type in the union is allowed. It increases code readability  as developers can clearly indicate a variable can be of multiple types improving the efficiency and readiability of code.
 Example:
 function printId(id:number | string){
    if(typeof id == 'string'){
        console.log("Id is a string")
    }
    else{
        console.log("Id is a number")
    }
 }
 Here the id can be either number or a string and typescript only allows these two types

 2. Intersection
 Intersection types combines multiple type definitions into one. & symbol is used to define it. A variable of this type must satisfy all the combined types. It ensures type Composition through combination of multiple type definitions into one type strictly ensuring the variable fulfills all the conditions. It is useful in modelling complex Objects as they are used of creating composite types that inherit properties from multiple interfaces or types. It also ensures code Reusability as developers can create complex types without rewriting multiple interfaces or types.
 Example:
 interface Person{
    name:string;
    age:number;
 }
 Interface Employee{
    employeeId: number;
    position: string;
 }
 type Member = Person & Employee;
 const john: Member = {
    name:"John",
    age:30,
    employeeId: 25,
    position: "software Engineer"
 }

 Here Member is an intersection type of interface Employee and Person. It has to fulfill the conditions of both Employee and Person otherwise it will give error
