# The Significance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript

In TypeScript, **Union** and **Intersection** types are unique and powerful features that allow developers to create flexible and type-safe code.

## 1. Union Types

Union types allow a value to be of different types, increasing efficiency and enabling the implementation of various functionalities. They are defined using the `|` (pipe) symbol. This feature provides type flexibility by enabling a variable to be declared with multiple types. While different input types are accepted, type safety is maintained. TypeScript ensures that only the types specified in the union are allowed, thus improving code readability by clearly indicating that a variable can hold multiple types.

### Example:
```typescript
function printId(id: number | string) {
    if (typeof id === 'string') {
        console.log("Id is a string");
    } else {
        console.log("Id is a number");
    }
}
2. Intersection Types
Intersection types combine multiple type definitions into one, using the & symbol. A variable of this type must satisfy all combined types. This feature ensures type composition by merging multiple type definitions, requiring the variable to meet all specified conditions. Intersection types are particularly useful for modeling complex objects, as they create composite types that inherit properties from multiple interfaces or types. They also promote code reusability by allowing developers to compose complex types without rewriting multiple type definitions.

Example:
typescript
Copy code
interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

interface Employee {
    employeeId: number;
    position: string;
}

type Member = Person & Employee;

const john: Member = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    employeeId: 25,
    position: "Software Engineer"
};
In the example above, Member is an intersection type of Person and Employee. The object john must satisfy all properties from both interfaces.
